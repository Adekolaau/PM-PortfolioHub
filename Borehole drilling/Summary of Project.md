# Project Title: Provision of Quality Water for Woji Community

**Overview:**

- Successfully managed and executed a comprehensive water provision project for Woji Community, using Microsoft Project for project management and Microsoft Excel for risk assessment.
- Ensured community engagement, thorough site assessment, and effective project execution, leading in the installation and commissioning of a water pump system.

**Project Activities:**

1. *Community Affairs:*

- Organized and conducted multiple community meetings to engage local stakeholders.
- Addressed potential risks such as kidnapping, political instability, and health hazards by engaging Community Liaison Officers (CLO), security escorts, and hiring vigilante groups.

2. *Site Assessment:*

- Conducted initial consultations, site reconnaissance, and historical data reviews.
- Performed soil sampling and analysis to determine the suitability of the site for water extraction.
- Prepared detailed reports and presented findings to clients.

3. *Geophysical Survey:*

- Planned and executed pre-survey activities, including equipment setup and calibration.
- Conducted field data acquisition, followed by data processing and interpretation.
- Prepared and presented final reports to clients, ensuring all findings were thoroughly reviewed.

4. *Mobilization and Drilling Operations:*

- Managed mobilization activities, overcoming funding delays through constant reminders.
- Supervised drilling operations with a focus on occupational and workplace safety, deploying an onsite Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) officer.

5. *Pump Installation and Commissioning:*

- Procured and installed the pump and related equipment, ensuring proper site preparation.
- Conducted testing and commissioning, addressing power failures with backup systems.

6. *Water Testing and Demobilization:*

- Performed water testing to ensure compliance with safety standards.
- Conducted site cleanup and handover, implementing safety protocols and community engagement to address any resilience issues.
